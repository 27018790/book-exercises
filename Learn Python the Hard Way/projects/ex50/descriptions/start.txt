You are Princess Leia.  You are trapped in the clutches of the evil Jabba the Hutt, who also has the love of your life, Han Solo, encased in a solid block of carbonite.  To amuse itself, Jabba will ask you 10 questions.  Depending on how well you do, it will let both you and Han go, let you go, or doom both of you to fates worse than death.  You do not trust Jabba any farther than you can throw him (and that's not very far), but deciding that a slim chance at freedom was better than no chance at all, you agree to the challenge.
